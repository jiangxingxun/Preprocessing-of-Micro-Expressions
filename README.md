## Pipeline for the Preprocessing of Micro-Expressions

This repo includes facial landmarks detection, alignment and cropping. We test our code on four public Micro-Expression (ME) databases, i.e. CASME II, SAMM, SMIC-HS, and MMEW. 

### Requirements

opencv

skimage

numpy

[face_alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment)

### How to Use

1. **facial landmarks detection**

   Just follow the introduction of this repo: [face_alignment](https://github.com/1adrianb/face-alignment) and install the dependency. The demo is shown in [fa_test.py](./fa_test.py).

2. Rewrite the [main.py](./main.py) and change the root directory according to your requirement.

### Contributions

All contributions are welcomed. If you have any confusions about the code feel free to contact weimengting@seu.edu.cn.
